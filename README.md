Resources for scratch projects

[https://scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu)


Are you a teacher or a parent and want to introduce your kids in
the fantastic world of programming??? Well, the most challenging 
thing with scratch nowadays is that the graphics are somewhat dull
to say the least. 

Mine aren't much better, but I've developed them by my self and 
you are free to use them if you want: with them you can create
a consistent game because I am giving the resources you need to 
acomplish the task.
